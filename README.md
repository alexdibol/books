# Research Books — AI & Finance

This repository hosts **long-form research works**—monographs and curated **compilations of papers**—written by Alejandro Reynoso, either **with or without the collaboration of AI tools**.  
All books involve **substantial human participation** (design, writing, editing, validation) and are intended as **examples of disciplined human–AI collaboration** exploring new frontiers in **artificial intelligence and finance**.

- Camera-ready **PDFs** are distributed via **GitHub Releases** (stable URLs).
- Optionally, releases are mirrored to **Zenodo** to mint **DOIs** for citation.
- Errata and updates are tracked in the release notes.

## Authorship & human–AI collaboration

These books may incorporate AI tools (for drafting, editing, code generation, or formatting), **under human direction and review**.  
Final responsibility for **ideas, structure, claims, math, and empirical results** rests with the human author.

---

## How this repository works

- **Releases:** Each book is published as a tagged release: `book-<slug>-vMAJOR.MINOR`.  
  Attach the **PDF** (and optional cover image) to the release.
- **Updates:** Fixes or new editions increment the version (e.g., `v1.1`, `v2.0`), with notes in the release changelog.
- **DOIs (optional):** If Zenodo is enabled for this repo, each release can mint a DOI; include it above.
